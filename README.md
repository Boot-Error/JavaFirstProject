# week4 task

Solve the below problem statements: (Use constructor, destructor , POJO where
ever it is possible.).

1. Write a java class (Int_Arr_Process)
	a. It is class to process a integer array.
	b. It should the following
	
i. It should define a integer array of given size
ii. If the size is not give it should define a array of 10
iii. It should be able to adopt a given array
iv. Should have a copy constructor
v. A function to read array
vi. A function to display array horizontally and vertically both
vii. A function to Sort a array
viii. A function to Find biggest and smallest element
ix. A function to Find the sum of all the element
x. If the second biggest (considering there is a possibility of the 1 st biggest
duplication)
2) Write a java class (Matrix)
a. It is class to process a matrix array.
b. It should the following
i. It should define a matrix of given size
ii. If the size is not give it should define a matrix of 3x3
iii. It should be able to adopt a given matrix
iv. Should have a copy constructor
v. A function to read matrix
vi. A function to display matrix in a matrix format
vii. A function to add two matrix function should receive one matrix and
return the addition matrix
viii. A function to Find matrix is scalar or not
ix. A function multiply the two matrix function should receive one matrix
and return the multiplied matrix

3) Write a java interface (Num_Process)
a. It will have a abstract method int cal(int a, int b) implement this interface using lambda
expression to add, subtract multiply and divice.
b. You should accept two number and choice from key board based on choice add ,sub,
multiply , divide . you should not use any control statement like if , switch case, ternary
operator.
